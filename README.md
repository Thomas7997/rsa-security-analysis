# RSA Keys analysis project  

## Description  

RSA keys project aims to analyze the security of keys with different bit sizes, ranging from 32 to 256 bits. The project includes statistical analysis on issues to elucidate why certain key sizes should be avoided for encryption.

## Steps to execute the project  

### Project initilisation  

```bash
	make
	bash init.sh
```

### Keys generation  

```bash
	bash generate.sh
```

### Key duplicates detection  

```bash
	bash keycopies.sh
```

### Prime numbers analysis  

```bash
	bash primecopies.sh
```
